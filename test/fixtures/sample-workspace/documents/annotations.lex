Annotations Test Fixture

This file will help for testing the annotations support in 3rd party editor plugins. Each session has an Annotation on it's first element, and some on the last.

1. An Intro

    :: note status=open ::
        This can test the resolve too.

2. Development

    :: note ::
        This one goes for session 2
    - This is applied on the list
    - Which is just as well
